A simple way to sign ECDSA pub/priv key pair challenges to prove ownership of an Ethereum account

##How to use
Some ethereum apps may ask you to prove ownership of a particular public address or public key by sending you a cryptographic challenge and then asking you to reply with a signature response.  This response can only be generated using a private key and this should be done offline.  This simple app will generate the proper signature using the challenge and the private key.
